The Challenge:

In this problem, we'll assume that phone numbers are four digits.
A phone number belongs to a telemarketer if its four digits satisfy all three
of the following properties:

1. The first digit is 8 or 9.
2. The fourth digit is 8 or 9.
3. The second and third digits are the same.

For example:
A phone number whose four digits are 8119 belongs to a telemarketer.

Determine whether a phone number belongs to a telemarketer, and indicate
whether we should answer the phone or ignore it.

Input

There are four lines of input. These lines give the Ô¨Årst, second, third, and
fourth digits of the phone number, respectively
Each digit is an integer between 0 and 9.

Output

If the phone number belongs to a telemarketer, output ignore;
otherwise, output answer.
